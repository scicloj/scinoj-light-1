# Hosts

Here are the conference hosts/emcees:

## Adham Omran
![](notebooks/images/Adham.jpeg){height=200}

Backend developer and data analyst specializing in Clojure. I build the API for iData, an Iraqi platform enabling data-driven decision-making. Passionate about Clojure's data analysis ecosystem.

 A backend developer with a passion for crafting efficient, scalable systems and uncovering valuable insights through data analysis. With experience in Clojure, Datomic, R & SQL, I specialize in leveraging its functional programming paradigm to build robust architectures that solve complex challenges with elegance and precision. Beyond development, I bring a strong focus on data analysis, using advanced methodologies to process, interpret, and visualize data in ways that empower decision-making. My ability to bridge backend development with actionable insights sets me apart as a versatile and impactful contributor to any team or project.
 


## Aditya Athalye
![](notebooks/images/Aditya.jpg){height=200}

Hi! Computationally, I identify as a Clojure-brained, mostly-functional, org-mode enjoying, grug-brained, generalist programmer. These days, I blog + think + work at evalapply.org. I've been Clojing since 2013, at work and/or as a hobbyist, and have lurked in the public Clojureverse for about the same time. I love teaching the language and ideas therein, and have had the chance to do so at various conferences (IN/Clojure, FunctionalConf, LambdaWorld), local meetups, and in-house for staff training. And I try to share / give back in the spirit of a self-directive called "Learn Generously". So, I am happy to make myself useful, here at SciCloj Light! May The Source be with us.
 


## Daniel Slutsky
![](notebooks/images/Daniel.jpeg){height=200}

Daniel Slutsky is a mathematician and a data science consultant. His current main focus is at the Scicloj group. There, he is involved in community building and co-maintaining a few of the Scicloj tools and libraries.
 His approach towards open-source communities is drawn from his past experiences in various activist groups and his involvement in local yoga communities.
 


## Kiran Kulkarni
![](notebooks/images/Kiran.jpg){height=200}

I'm Kiran Kulkarni—a data nerd who believes in making decisions with gut and validating with data. I began as a Linux Kernel developer, then built high-scale backend systems in Clojure and big data pipelines that processed TBs data daily in Python. I’m passionate about building high-quality products, high-performing teams, scalable architectures, and insightful data systems. Also, I love street food and traveling to explore street food.
 


## Lorelai Lyons
![](notebooks/images/Lor.jpg){height=200}

Lorelai is a technologist and artist exploring the intersection of neuroscience, programming, and ethics. With a background in music and philosophy, she brings a unique perspective to data science—blending curiosity, critical thinking, and creative expression.

 She's active in the Clojure community as a board member of Clojurists Together, a member of Clojure Camp, and an organizer with SciCloj. Lorelai is currently focused on developing accessible tooling for brain-computer interfaces, advocating for ethical neurotechnology, and making brain data more approachable for developers of all backgrounds.
