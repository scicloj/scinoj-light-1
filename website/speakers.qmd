# Speakers

Here are the conference speakers:

## Cvetomir M Dimov
![](notebooks/images/Cvetomir.jpeg){height=200}

I am a researcher in Cognitive Psychology. In previous work I have studied human decision making, skill acquisition and memory. My recent focus has been the study of the complex processes behind collaboration. I have already developed a collaborative skill acquisition model. I am currently working on refining that model with speech capabilities.
 


## Daniel Slutsky
