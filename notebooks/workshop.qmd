# Workshop

On May 10th, 2025, we will run an online intro workshop about Clojure for data analysis.

It is intended to get people started with Clojure for data analysis and be more comfortable attending the [SciNoj Light #1](https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/) conference talks.

See the [initial blog post]((https://scicloj.github.io/blog/data-analyis-with-clojure-free-workshop-may-10th-initial-survey/)) for additional background.

## Groups

To account for diverse time zones, we will have two runs of the workshop:

- Group A - [May 10th 9:00-13:00 UTC](https://time.is/09:00_10_MAY_2025_in_UTC) - ðŸ“… [event](https://clojureverse.org/t/scinoj-light-1-prep-workshop-data-analysis-in-clojure-group-a/)
- Group B - [May 10th 15:00-19:00 UTC](https://time.is/15:00_10_MAY_2025_in_UTC) - ðŸ“… [event](https://clojureverse.org/t/scinoj-light-1-prep-workshop-data-analysis-in-clojure-group-b/11370)

(Note we use the [UTC](https://time.is/UTC) time zone here.)

* Read this page carefully and make sure it is all clear.
* Sign up to the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/), and introduce yourself at the [#**scinoj-light-1 > hello**](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479601-scinoj-light-1/topic/hello/) topic thread.
* Make sure you have the following installed in your system: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)).
  * If you are familiar with the setup of another editor for Clojure, then please make sure you have [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) working in your setup. You can write to, and we may be able to help.
* We recommend also installing [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
* Follow the ðŸŽ¥ [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1yPkpyiEEs) and make sure it works in your system. The project used in that video is ðŸ”— [noj-v2-getting-started](https://github.com/scicloj/noj-v2-getting-started).

## Plan

- We will assume some background in programming (say, at least 2 years with any programming language). If you are unsure, please reach out.
- We will not assume any background in Clojure or in data analysis.
- We will start from scratch, including an introduction to Clojure.
- We will introduce the [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/) toolkit and use it in analysing real-world data.
- We will introduce essential notions of probability and statistics.
- The content will be inspired by (but different from) Kira Howe's great [workshop](https://bobkonf.de/2025/howe.html) at the [BobKonf 2025](https://bobkonf.de/2025/en/) conference.
