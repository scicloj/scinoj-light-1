# Workshop

On May 10th, 2025, we ran an online intro workshop about Clojure for data analysis.

The goal was to get people started with Clojure for data analysis and be more comfortable attending the [SciNoj Light #1](https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/) conference talks.

See the [initial blog post](https://scicloj.github.io/blog/data-analyis-with-clojure-free-workshop-may-10th-initial-survey/) for additional background.

## Groups

To account for diverse time zones, we had two runs of the workshop:

- Group A - [May 10th 9:00-13:00 UTC](https://time.is/09:00_10_MAY_2025_in_UTC) - ðŸ“… [event](https://clojureverse.org/t/scinoj-light-1-prep-workshop-data-analysis-in-clojure-group-a/)
- Group B - [May 10th 15:00-19:00 UTC](https://time.is/15:00_10_MAY_2025_in_UTC) - ðŸ“… [event](https://clojureverse.org/t/scinoj-light-1-prep-workshop-data-analysis-in-clojure-group-b/11370)

## Recordings

The recordings were shared (as unlisted videos) internally at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/) under the [#**scinoj-light-1>recordings**](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479601-scinoj-light-1/topic/recordings/) topic thread.

## Background

We recommended the following background to workshop participants:

* Read this page carefully and make sure it is all clear.
* Sign up to the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/), and introduce yourself at the [#**scinoj-light-1 > hello**](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479601-scinoj-light-1/topic/hello/) topic thread.
* Make sure you have the following installed in your system: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)).
  * If you are familiar with the setup of another editor for Clojure, then please make sure you have [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) working in your setup. You can write to, and we may be able to help.
* We recommend also installing [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
* Follow the ðŸŽ¥ [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1yPkpyiEEs) and make sure it works in your system. The project used in that video is ðŸ”— [noj-v2-getting-started](https://github.com/scicloj/noj-v2-getting-started).

## Agenda

- We assumed some background in programming (say, at least 2 years with any programming language). If you are unsure, please reach out.
- We did not assume any background in Clojure or in data analysis.
- We started from scratch, including a brief introduction to Clojure.
- We introduced the [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/) toolkit and use it in analysing real-world data.
- We introduced essential notions of probability and statistics.

## Questions

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate asking at the [#**scinoj-light-1 > questions**](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479601-scinoj-light-1/topic/questions/) topic thread.
