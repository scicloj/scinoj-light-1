Here we use this video game to study individual planning. We developed multiple levels for this task and tested these levels in a series of studies. These studies allowed us to identify a set of levels that lie within the capabilities of the general population. Moreover, they allowed us to determine level parameters that determine level difficulty.13:00-13:50Brain Data in Clojure &gt;(data-analysis session)Lorelai LyonsThis is an introductory talk to the field of Brain-Computer Interfacing, and how Clojure can power intuitive, composable data workflows for real-world brain data.

This talk with analyze the impact of lane reductions and addition of bike lanes and bus loading islands by examining crash data before and after the redesign in of Telegraph Ave in 2021.

I will walk through how I implemented the Burgers’ equation solver in 1-D in Clojure, referenced from the 12-step CFDPython series (https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython). Using data generated from my simulation, I will demonstrate how shock structures are smoothed by viscosity and how nonlinear interactions evolve over time. Along the way, I will reflect on the process of learning the essence of the Burgers’ equation, then implementing it in a functional programming paradigm, and close with a glimpse of future directions, including extending these ideas toward multidimensional simulations and more complex flow behavior.11:00-11:50Tropical cyclone trajectory modelling &gt;(data-analysis session)K Ram NarayanNaimish Mani BTropical Cyclone's happen every year and claim hundreds of lives and billions in damages. Accurate cyclone track forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation.

Clojure, with its immutable data structures, functional paradigm, REPL-driven development, and a community that values simplicity and composability, is uniquely positioned to take these ideas even further. What we’re building isn’t just a set of libraries, it’s a new way of thinking about data.This talk is about how we get there, together. We’ll explore the principles that have guided the evolution of Scicloj, the challenges we’ve encountered, and the opportunities ahead. From our grassroots beginnings to a future of powerful, unified tools, this is a call to help shape the next chapter, and to imagine what data science and data engineering can become when they're built the Clojure way.15:00-16:20macroexpand-1 &gt;(special session)This will be the first meeting in the new series of macroexpand gatherings.

I’ve been Clojing since 2013, at work and/or as a hobbyist, and have lurked in the public Clojureverse for about the same time. I love teaching the language and ideas therein, and have had the chance to do so at various conferences (IN/Clojure, FunctionalConf, LambdaWorld), local meetups, and in-house for staff training. And I try to share / give back in the spirit of a self-directive called “Learn Generously”. So, I am happy to make myself useful, here at SciCloj Light! May The Source be with us."

Using data generated from my simulation, I will demonstrate how shock structures are smoothed by viscosity and how nonlinear interactions evolve over time.
