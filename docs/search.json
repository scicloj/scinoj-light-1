We‚Äôll explore the principles that have guided the evolution of Scicloj, the challenges we‚Äôve encountered, and the opportunities ahead. From our grassroots beginnings to a future of powerful, unified tools, this is a call to help shape the next chapter, and to imagine what data science and data engineering can become when they're built the Clojure way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15:00-16:50\n\n\n\n\nmacroexpand-1\n\n\n(special session)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be the first meeting in the new series of macroexpand gatherings. It will focus on initiating new projects of research/teaching/implementation/documentation/study group, that we will be running towards the next SciNoj conference later this year.\nThe session will begin by a few brief experience reports and proposals by participants. Then we will expand the discussion till we converge to actionable steps we will follow up on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17:00-17:50\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact of Lane Reductions: A Data-Driven Look at Oakland Streets\n\n\n(data-analysis session)\n\n\nHeather Moore-Farley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe City of Oakland has done work to implement traffic calming measures on many of their streets. Do these reduce crashes and injuries? This talk with analyze the impact of lane reductions and addition of bike lanes and bus loading islands by examining crash data before and after the redesign in of Telegraph Ave in 2021. Then, I‚Äôll look at Grand Avenue, which has not received any traffic calming measures, to explore who is currently most affect by traffic violence and who could benefit from similar interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18:00-18:50\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing Nairobi Bus Routes with Graph Algorithms and Agent-based Simulation\n\n\n(data-analysis session)\n\n\nJulius Kibunjia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exploration of Nairobi's new and existing bus routes to compare differences in traffic congestion, transit time and ease of travel between points. We build a graph representation of the routes on which we compute metrics and assess the behavior of agents in a simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19:00-19:20\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n19:30-20:30\n\nOpen chat (hosted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource: notebooks/schedule.clj"
